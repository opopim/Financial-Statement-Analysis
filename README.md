# Financial-Statement-Analysis
You are a Data Scientist working for a consulting ﬁrm. One of your colleagues from the Auditing department has asked you to help them assess the ﬁnancial statement of organisation X. You have been supplied with two lists of data: monthly revenue and monthly expenses for the ﬁnancial year in question. 

# Your task is to calculate the following ﬁnancial metrics:
1. proﬁt for each month
2. proﬁt after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
3. proﬁt margin for each month - equals to proﬁt after tax divided by revenue
4. good months - where the proﬁt after tax was greater than the mean for the year 
5. bad months - where the proﬁt after tax was less than the mean for the year
6. the best month - where the proﬁt after tax was max for the year
7. the worst month - where the proﬁt after tax was min for the year

# Provision:
- All results need to be presented as lists. 
- Results for dollar values need to be calculated with $0.01 precision, but need to be presented in Units of $1,000 (i.e . 1k) with no decimal points.
- Results for the proﬁt mar gin ratio need to be presented in units of % with no decimal points.
- Note: Your colleague has war ned you that it is okay for tax for any given month to be negative (in accounting ter ms, negative tax tr anslates into a defer red tax asset).
